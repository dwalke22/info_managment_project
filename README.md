# Furniture Rental System

## Purpose:
This application is for renting furniture from a store. The application has a general employee role and a admin role. The general employee role has the ability to add a customer to the data base, checkout furniture, and return furniture.

## Steps to Running the Project

### 1. Installing the Libraries
Once the project is loaded into Visual Studio, the following libraries will need to be installed. The libraries are:
* Microsoft.NETCore.UniversalWindowsPlatform
* MySql.Data
* MySqlConnector

These libraries should be installed automatically if the solution is built, but if not the above classes will need to be installed by hand.

### 2. Running The Project
Once the proper libraries are installed, you are ready to run the project. Once you run the project you will land on a login page for the project. There are two combinations of usernames and passwords, one is for the admin role and the other is for a general employee. The combinations are:
* Admin: dwalke/password
* Employee: john1/password

These combinations will get you into the system and into the respective parts of the system.
